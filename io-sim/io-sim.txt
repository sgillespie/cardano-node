module Control.Monad.IOSim
data IOSim s a
type STMSim = STM

-- | <a>IOSim</a> is a pure monad.
runSim :: forall a. (forall s. IOSim s a) -> Either Failure a

-- | For quick experiments and tests it is often appropriate and convenient
--   to simply throw failures as exceptions.
runSimOrThrow :: forall a. (forall s. IOSim s a) -> a

-- | Like <a>runSim</a> but fail when the main thread terminates if there
--   are other threads still running or blocked. If one is trying to follow
--   a strict thread clean-up policy then this helps testing for that.
runSimStrictShutdown :: forall a. (forall s. IOSim s a) -> Either Failure a

-- | Simulation terminated a failure.
data Failure

-- | The main thread terminated with an exception.
FailureException :: SomeException -> Failure

-- | The threads all deadlocked.
FailureDeadlock :: ![Labelled IOSimThreadId] -> Failure

-- | The main thread terminated normally but other threads were still
--   alive, and strict shutdown checking was requested. See
--   <a>runSimStrictShutdown</a>.
FailureSloppyShutdown :: [Labelled IOSimThreadId] -> Failure

-- | An exception was thrown while evaluation the trace. This could be an
--   internal assertion failure of `io-sim` or an unhandled exception in
--   the simulation.
FailureEvaluation :: SomeException -> Failure

-- | An internal failure of the simulator.
--   
--   Please open an issue at
--   <a>https://github.com/input-output-hk/io-sim/issues</a>.
FailureInternal :: String -> Failure

-- | See <a>runSimTraceST</a> below.
runSimTrace :: forall a. (forall s. IOSim s a) -> SimTrace a

-- | The most general method of running <a>IOSim</a> is in <a>ST</a> monad.
--   One can recover failures or the result from <a>SimTrace</a> with
--   <a>traceResult</a>, or access <a>SimEventType</a>s generated by the
--   computation with <a>traceEvents</a>. A slightly more convenient way is
--   exposed by <a>runSimTrace</a>.
runSimTraceST :: forall s a. IOSim s a -> ST s (SimTrace a)

-- | Execute a simulation, discover &amp; revert races. Note that this will
--   execute the simulation multiple times with different schedules, and
--   thus it's much more costly than a simple <a>runSimTrace</a> (also the
--   simulation environments has much more state to track and hence is
--   slower).
--   
--   On property failure it will show the failing schedule
--   (<a>ScheduleControl</a>) which can be plugged to
--   <a>controlSimTrace</a>.
--   
--   Note: <a>exploreSimTrace</a> evaluates each schedule in parallel
--   (using <tt>par</tt>).
exploreSimTrace :: forall a test. Testable test => (ExplorationOptions -> ExplorationOptions) -> (forall s. IOSim s a) -> (Maybe (SimTrace a) -> SimTrace a -> test) -> Property

-- | An <a>ST</a> version of <a>exploreSimTrace</a>. The callback also
--   receives <a>ScheduleControl</a>. This is mostly useful for testing
--   <i>IOSimPOR</i> itself.
--   
--   Note: <a>exploreSimTraceST</a> evaluates each schedule sequentially.
exploreSimTraceST :: forall s a test. Testable test => (ExplorationOptions -> ExplorationOptions) -> (forall s. IOSim s a) -> (Maybe (SimTrace a) -> SimTrace a -> ST s test) -> ST s Property

-- | Run a simulation using a given schedule. This is useful to reproduce
--   failing cases without exploring the races.
controlSimTrace :: forall a. Maybe Int -> ScheduleControl -> (forall s. IOSim s a) -> SimTrace a
controlSimTraceST :: Maybe Int -> ScheduleControl -> IOSim s a -> ST s (SimTrace a)

-- | A schedule modification inserted at given execution step.
data ScheduleMod
ScheduleMod :: StepId -> ScheduleControl -> [StepId] -> ScheduleMod

-- | Step at which the <a>ScheduleMod</a> is activated.
[scheduleModTarget] :: ScheduleMod -> StepId

-- | <a>ScheduleControl</a> at the activation step. It is needed by
--   <tt>extendScheduleControl</tt> when combining the discovered schedule
--   with the initial one.
[scheduleModControl] :: ScheduleMod -> ScheduleControl

-- | Series of steps which are executed at the target step. This *includes*
--   the target step, not necessarily as the last step.
[scheduleModInsertion] :: ScheduleMod -> [StepId]

-- | Modified execution schedule.
data ScheduleControl

-- | default scheduling mode
ControlDefault :: ScheduleControl

-- | if the current control is <a>ControlAwait</a>, the normal scheduling
--   will proceed, until the thread found in the first <a>ScheduleMod</a>
--   reaches the given step. At this point the thread is put to sleep,
--   until after all the steps are followed.
ControlAwait :: [ScheduleMod] -> ScheduleControl

-- | follow the steps then continue with schedule modifications. This
--   control is set by <tt>followControl</tt> when <tt>controlTargets</tt>
--   returns true.
ControlFollow :: [StepId] -> [ScheduleMod] -> ScheduleControl
type ExplorationSpec = ExplorationOptions -> ExplorationOptions

-- | Race exploration options.
data ExplorationOptions
ExplorationOptions :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Int -> Maybe ScheduleControl -> Int -> ExplorationOptions

-- | This is an upper bound on the number of schedules with race reversals
--   that will be explored; a bound of zero means that the default schedule
--   will be explored, but no others. Setting the bound to zero makes
--   IOSimPOR behave rather like IOSim, in that only one schedule is
--   explored, but (a) IOSimPOR is considerably slower, because it still
--   collects information on potential races, and (b) the IOSimPOR schedule
--   is different (based on priorities, in contrast to IOSim's
--   round-robin), and plays better with shrinking.
--   
--   The default value is `100`.
[explorationScheduleBound] :: ExplorationOptions -> Int

-- | The branching factor. This is the number of alternative schedules that
--   IOSimPOR tries to run, per race reversal. With the default parameters,
--   IOSimPOR will try to reverse the first 33 (100 div 3) races discovered
--   using the default schedule, then (if 33 or more races are discovered),
--   for each such reversed race, will run the reversal and try to reverse
--   two more races in the resulting schedule. A high branching factor will
--   explore more combinations of reversing fewer races, within the overall
--   schedule bound. A branching factor of one will explore only schedules
--   resulting from a single race reversal (unless there are fewer races
--   available to be reversed than the schedule bound).
--   
--   The default value is `3`.
[explorationBranching] :: ExplorationOptions -> Int

-- | Limit on the computation time allowed per scheduling step, for
--   catching infinite loops etc.
--   
--   The default value is <a>Nothing</a>.
[explorationStepTimelimit] :: ExplorationOptions -> Maybe Int

-- | A schedule to replay.
--   
--   The default value is <a>Nothing</a>.
[explorationReplay] :: ExplorationOptions -> Maybe ScheduleControl

-- | Log detailed trace to stderr containing information on discovered
--   races. The trace does not contain the result of the simulation, unless
--   one will do that explicitly inside the simulation.
--   
--   level 0: don't show any output, level 1: show simulation trace with
--   discovered schedules level 2: show simulation trace with discovered
--   schedules and races
--   
--   NOTE: discovered schedules &amp; races are not exposed to the user in
--   the callback of <tt>exploreSimTrace</tt> or in the output of
--   <tt>controlSimTrace</tt>.

--   
--   Note: you can use <a>MonadST</a> to lift <a>ST</a> computations, this
--   is just a more convenient function just for <a>IOSim</a>.
liftST :: ST s a -> IOSim s a

-- | Set the current wall clock time for the thread's clock domain.
setCurrentTime :: UTCTime -> IOSim s ()

-- | Put the thread into a new wall clock domain, not shared with the

--   by this thread from this point onwards will share the new clock
